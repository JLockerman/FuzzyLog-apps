How to generate gnuplot graphs (eps format)

Preparation:
1. eps_gen.sh and synthetic_workload_latency.gnu should be in the same directory.

2. Input data file should have extension ".data".

3. Each row of the input file should have the format (seq# breakdown_latency_1 breakdown_latency_2 ...)

4. The script only uses breakdown_latency_1 and breakdown_latency_2

5. The script only uses the first 100 rows for now for plotting.

6. Place all .data file you want to generate graphs from in the same directory.

Running:

  ./eps_gen.sh <input dir> <output dir>

  - input dir: dir where the .data files are at.
  - output dir: dir where the .eps file will be generated.
